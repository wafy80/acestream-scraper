# Development Phases for Acestream Scraper Rewrite

This document outlines the development phases for rewriting the Acestream Scraper application within the existing repository structure. The goal is to create a completely new application in a separate folder while maintaining the current one until the new version is fully ready.

## Project Goal

To rebuild Acestream Scraper with modern technologies:
- **Backend**: FastAPI (replacing Flask-RESTX)
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy with modern typing
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI-driven API documentation
- **Deployment**: Unified deployment with Docker

## Development Strategy

Rather than migrating the application in-place, we will:

1. Create a new `v2/` directory in the repository
2. Develop the new application in this isolated directory
3. Keep the current application running unmodified
4. When the new application is ready, switch to it completely

## Working with the Existing Database

To ensure compatibility with the current application, we can:

1. **Use the same database file**: Configure the new application to use the existing SQLite database file.

2. **Maintain schema compatibility**: Ensure models in the new application match the current database schema to avoid breaking changes.

3. **Add new tables separately**: Use table prefixes for new features to avoid clashing with the existing schema.

4. **Migration script**: Create a migration script to run when transitioning fully to the new application.

## Development Guidelines

- **Parallel development**: Develop new features independently from the existing application.
- **Feature parity first**: Ensure the new application matches all current functionality before adding new features.
- **Testing**: Implement comprehensive tests to ensure the new application works as expected.
- **Documentation**: Document all APIs, features, and configuration options.
- **AI-driven development**: Leverage AI coding assistants to accelerate development.
